  ## Description
  This app is used to help keep project managers organized when it comes to their production staff. It not only lists who is on their staff, but also their name, employee ID number, email and a bit extra depending on their role. The manager will have the associated office number. The engineers will have their personal GitHub repos attached. And the intern's will have their current schools listed.

  ## Usage
  After getting the code onto your machine, you will need to run "npm i" to ensure you have all the required modules initialized from npm. After that simply type "node index" into your terminal and follow the on screen prompts. The generated HTML page will be deployed into the "dist" directory.

  ## Tests
  After ensuring you have entered "npm i" in your terminal to install not only inquirer, but my testing platform, jest. You will then only need to type "npm test" into the terminal to see the provided tests in this project. I wrote test cases for each of the classes; the construction, and each individual get method has been fully tested and can be seen for yourself with the "npm test" command.
